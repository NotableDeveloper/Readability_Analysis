What is one thing that has changed the world?

With the development of the Internet and smartphones, people have increased their connections with people who are far away. Ironically, community development has led to a lack of connectivity with people close to it. The proportion of lonely deaths proves this. Few people know who lives right next door and how they are doing. In this era, the app "Carrot Market" enhances the closeness of neighbors and adds warmth to the bleak period. Several systems in the carrot market make this possible.

First of all, the carrot market, unlike other second-hand goods exchange platforms, is the only one that has a system that induces neighborhood certification and direct transactions with neighbors. Statistically, people become more polite in face-to-face transactions than in non-face-to-face transactions and don't lie about products they want to sell. Such a system not only increases confidence in the carrot market but also in the neighborhood.

Next, the 'manner temperature' rating, which is reflected in the reviews sent after the deal is completed, induces people to have manners during the exchange process. This is why there are more free sharing in the carrot market than other apps. Those who receive free sharing simultaneously receive warmth from their neighbors, which in turn circulates in a way that offers good-quality goods to their neighbors at a reasonable price.

In conclusion, the carrot market's direct trading platform and post-system make you feel warmhearted with your neighbors. In an age when people don't know who lives next door, it helps people realize that they also have warm neighbors in their neighborhood, and it helps them feel heartfelt with their nationals. Unlike the development of electronic devices, carrot markets are changing the world by bringing warmth to people's minds.
