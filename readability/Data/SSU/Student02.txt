We often face a variety of problems in our lives. Furthermore, we have lived with many problems. Today, I will talk about problems that I face in several sides. Insomnia, backward buildings, and fine dust are main element of my opinion.

First, insomnia is my personal problem. I often do not have enough time to sleep well even if it was dawn. Because of this, I am always tired that day. If I do not solve this, I probably will not take classes well. Therefore, I recalled my best experience when I slept well to solve this problem. Through this, I guessed that cause of problem was irregular sleep time. I think that this problem will be solved if I have a regular sleep habit.

Second, backward buildings are problem in Soongsil University. Like ‘Vision Hall’, there are too many buildings that are behind the times. At there, there is no toilet and elevator. Because of this, students suffer from discomfort. If this problem do not solve, people will probably continue to go to school with discomfort. Meanwhile, our university have recognized this problem. Maybe this problem will be solved through remodeling buildings in a few years.

Finally, fine dust is problem in Korea. It have affected badly to our health. Because of this, people spend days with masks. If this problem do not solve, people will definitely have fatal diseases. Government is trying to solve this problem through various policies. However, unlike their efforts, fine dust is still too much in air. Because main cause of dust is china, I think this problem will be solved through conference between the two countries.

To summarize, lack of sleep, old buildings, and air pollution are problems that I face. What are your problems in your life now? Whatever they are, I hope that they are solved.
