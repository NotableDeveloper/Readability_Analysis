Smartphones are so commercialized that it is hard to find people who don't use smartphones in modern society. As such, a smartphone is having a significant impact on our overall lives. Therefore, I regard the smartphone as the most significant factor that has changed the world for the following reasons.

First, it facilitates communication between people. Through the medium of cell phones, humans have overcome the time and space limitations of communication. Specifically, we can communicate news among people much faster than in the past. On top of that, smartphones have made it possible for people to talk to each other, showing their faces to each other even though they are very far away.

Second, it makes financial services more convenient. In the past, people had to visit banks directly when they had to do economic work, but now they can easily use financial services anytime, anywhere, through apps installed on smartphones. Not to mention that these applications allow people to transfer money at any time without using a computer efficiently. Besides, smartphones' convenience has increased as products can be purchased only with a smartphone without cash or credit card.

Finally, it provides us useful information conveniently. For instance, it identifies our location information in real-time and tells us the fastest and most accurate route when we go to a new place. Furthermore, it informs weather information such as fine dust levels, humidity, and temperature.

To sum up, smartphones are a revolution that has turned the world upside down. Smartphones can be said to have changed our world the most in that it made things possible that were impossible in the past.
