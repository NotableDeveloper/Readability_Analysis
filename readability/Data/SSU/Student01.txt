What do you think of smoking? Many people have different ideas about this. However, many non-smokers have negative ideas about it. Then, I would like to ask a college student among them. Should smoking be banned on campus? Or not? There will be a variety of answers, but I would say that it is fair to ban smoking on campus. Because cigarettes affect badly them and others.
First, cigarettes contain bad substances such as tar and nicotine. Tar is dangerous because it has carcinogens like benzene. Nicotine is also dangerous because it is a poison that causes various diseases. Therefore, smoking is bad for them and they need to be restrained. However, these acts have a bad influence on not only them but also others. Beyond them, it affects badly on the others.
For example, When you smoke, the smoke spreads far away, and it affects many others. Then they have to take on the bad smoke of cigarettes even though they don't want to. Therefore, this act is an expression of no respect for others, and a blatant violation of their rights. A Campus is a public place for many people. Therefore, any person's rights should be respected here. Besides, schools should consider everyone by banning smoking on campus.
On the other hand, cigarettes affect a bad influence on smokers with different nuances. It creates money problems for buyers because it is expensive. The price of cigarettes is the same as the price of a meal. This is dramatic, but they bring more spending than they do not. In this regard, banning smoking on campus will give them a great opportunity to quit smoking.
Although some people say that smoking is an individual's freedom and should not be interrupted. But freedom exists when it does not infringe upon the rights of others. That's why smoking on campus should be banned for all. Although our school is not currently banned from smoking. But if you are a smoker, I hope you think about the impact you have on the campus.
