The United States was the first country to start nuclear power generation from the dawn of nuclear power plants in the 1950s and 1970s to the active introduction. After U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower delivered a speech called Atoms for Peace at the U.N. General Assembly in 1953, efforts to make peaceful use of nuclear power began. In fact, in 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an international organization aimed at banning nuclear power for military purposes, was established.

With the advent of nuclear power plants, life in the world has been enhanced easily and economically. If nuclear power plants did not appear, we would not live like the Paleolithic Age. The advantages of nuclear power plants are clean energy, economical, easy to transport, and environmental protection because nuclear power plants can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase large-scale. However, the typical disadvantage is nuclear accidents' risk since any nuclear power plant could have a fatal radiation leak to humans and the environment. A typical example is the explosion of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan.

Nuclear power plants are now a vital existence in the world. Because if nuclear power plants don't work, most companies don't have a way to provide energy. And because nuclear power plants produce a lot of energy, not fossil fuels, but eco-friendly energy. When eco-friendly energy is generated, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Nuclear power plants are essential, but people's safety is dangerous if security is not thoroughly and meticulously maintained.
