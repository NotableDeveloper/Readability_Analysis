What is one thing that has changed the world? - oil industry

If somebody asks me a question about choosing one thing that has changed the world, I would say oil has virtually changed the world. Think about when we don't have the oil. Factories would stop running. So would cars and airplanes be grounded? And people's homes and offices, if heated by oil, would freeze in winter. Products that are made of oil will be unable to use like plastics. Isn't it amazing that oil has penetrated deep into our lives? Let me explain one by one.

Oil provides fuel for vehicles and airplanes to carry goods and people all over the world. Before oil was discovered, ordinary people could not drive a car because of bulky and inefficient fuel like coal. After the oil has been found, the ford car has been cut off the beginning. Your parents couldn't drive their car unless they were filled with gasoline or petrol. The school bus couldn't make it to school without gas. So would airplanes be grounded too?

Second, oil provides many products for our lives. For example, oil's refined products are used to manufacture almost all chemical products, such as plastics, fertilizers, detergents, paints, and even medicines, plus a whole host of other products that you might not expect. Those factors show that product made out of oil has been affected our lives.

With the technological breakthroughs of the 20th century, oil has emerged as the preferred energy source. The key drivers of that transformation were the electric light bulb and the automobile. Automobile ownership and electricity demand grew exponentially and, with them, the oil demand. And these days, oil still preferred to use as the primary energy source or main material. Thus, there is no doubt that oil has been changed the world.
