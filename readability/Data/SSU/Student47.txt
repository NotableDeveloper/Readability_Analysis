Since the publication of 'The Wealth of Nations' in 1776, the world has experienced a revolution from mercantilism to capitalism. The increase in output from the industrial revolution has led people to enjoy affluence that they have never imagined before. Today most countries in the world operate under the capitalist economic system. There was a brief wave of socialism in Russia, but capitalism eventually won, solidifying its position in society. Therefore, there is no doubt that capitalism today dominates our society, so I would like to talk about how capitalism has changed our world.

First, capitalism is the most suitable institution for satisfying human desires. Before capitalism began, Christianity limited private property for moral reasons. However, Adam Smith, who is called the father of economics, morally justified personal property by proving in 'The Wealth of Nations' that individual selfishness can promote public interests. Capitalism has enabled people who have suppressed their desires in the past to work for themselves and encourage social development at the same time. As a result, people worked harder, and the world developed beyond imagination. About this, Adam Smith said this famous thing. "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect to eat our dinner, but from their regard to their interest."

Second, capitalism distributes resources most efficiently. The production class and the receiving class were divided in the past, so all distribution was unfair. However, in modern capitalist society, resources are distributed most efficiently because the person who wants some products pays the highest amount. For example, when a computer is produced, there is no need to think about who will have it in a capitalist society. This is because prices are already determined by consumer demand and supplier supply. The consumer who pays the price is the one who wants the product the most. This mechanism creates the most efficient and fair society without dispute.

However, capitalism was not always positive. Since the advent of the capitalist society, the gap between the rich and the poor has become very extreme. The huge inheritance of capitalists changed the starting line of competition, and fairness collapsed. Because of these side effects, the advantages of capitalism are not functioning correctly. Many people live in a world full of resources but do not have raw food, clothing, and shelter. Perhaps this irony is the most significant change made by capitalism.

In summary, capitalism has changed the world completely. Through competition, we achieved an efficient society and fulfilled everyone's desires. On the other hand, it also led to negative changes such as the gap between the rich and the poor. An effort will be needed to keep an eye on this change and go in a positive direction.
