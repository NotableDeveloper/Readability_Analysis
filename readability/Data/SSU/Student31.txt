Since many creators appeared on YouTube, the era of TV has gone downhill. YouTube is overwhelmingly competitive in video streaming services, and YouTube stars breathe in people's hands. YouTube makes it easy for anyone to enjoy a variety of content on YouTube.

YouTube is a content paradise where there are entertainment, music, cooking, games, dramas, etc. Every generation watches this content to their taste. If it has been broadcast by several broadcasters so far, countless people now produce content with their ideas. If you want to learn cooking, you can learn cooking through Youtube, and if you like animals, you can feel the cuteness of animals indirectly through Youtube. However, as contents' limitations are gradually revealed, there are many problems such as provocative content production.

As mentioned earlier, YouTube is ending the era of TV. Ten years ago, we heard the laughter of our family watching TV on weekend evenings. But now it's time to hold your cell phone and laugh in your room. According to data surveyed by a digital marketing company in 2018, 91 percent of the respondents said they watch YouTube at least once in a week, with 58 percent saying their TV ratings declined compared to a year ago. This was especially true for those in their 20s and 30s. As with the statistics, the most popular content on Korean TV programs until recently was the trot. The trot is content that is mostly watched by people in their 40s and 50s. This reflects the trend as the ratings of those in their 20s and 30s decrease. Of course, it's following the times, but unlike the evening when families gather and watch TV as before, the evening of staying alone has become more familiar to us.

YouTube has created many celebrities. In the past, it received a lot of attention through TV, but now the general public has easily become a YouTuber, drawing attention from many people. One of the reasons why many people want to be a YouTuber is that they efficiently produce their content and get a lot of attention, but it is also because of YouTube's profit structure. When you upload a video on YouTube, you get a lot of advertising and profit from it. They also earn profits through sponsorship. According to the Korea Labor Institute report, the average annual salary of YouTubers is 64 million won. Top billion-dollar YouTubers raised the figure, but it has to draw much attention from many ordinary people's perspective. However, the problem is that the general YouTuber is stressed out by malicious comments or excessive interest.

To sum up, YouTube has created many good things, including producing a lot of content, creating celebrities, and creating a new era. But it also created some bad things, such as stimulating content, celebrities suffering from malicious comments, and lonely dinners. We should distinguish these good from the bad
