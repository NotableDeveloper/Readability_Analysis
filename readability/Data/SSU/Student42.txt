The universe has always been a subject of curiosity since the birth of humankind. In space, humans are smaller than a grain of sand. However, SpaceX challenged this and launched the first civilian crewed spacecraft on May 31, 2020, opening the era of civilian space exploration.

First, SpaceX's civilian spacecraft launch went beyond a nation's concept and united humankind as a man of the earth. We depend on our state and live our entire lives as members of a state. But the universe is not the property of any country, and it is an area that humans have not fully identified. Then we must educate and study it under the name of humankind. SpaceX has proven that the space industry, which has always been under the name of a nation, can succeed under one human name.

Secondly, SpaceX vividly shows people the status of space technology and has taken the space industry to a new level technically and culturally through its superior technology supporting it. Since its early days, SpaceX has proudly revealed not only successful cases but also disastrous failures. Direct explosion images and success videos have made people aware that SpaceX is continuously trying. And it was part of an effort to get people interested in the space industry at least once. It has also attracted global attention, showing remarkable technological advances, including the retracing of the launched projectile.

In conclusion, SpaceX is the most direct example of shock and hope for us since humans explored the universe. Of course, it will take a long time, but it is already the story of SpaceX that ordinary citizens like us launch spacecraft and go into space. It doesn't feel like a real benefit to us right now, but it's going to be a far more significant change for the foreseeable future or the next generation.
