What value do you think people pursue in life? I think it must be Convenience. And I think it is the smartphone that satisfies that Convenience the most. So I think one thing that has changed the world is smartphones.

First, smartphones are convenient to use the Internet. In modern times, people search the Internet on their cell phones to find out what they don't know or find out about various news. Of course, this is an advantage of the Internet's development, but it is the function of smartphones that make information easily accessible anytime, anywhere.

Second, smartphones are effortless to connect with others. Recently, SNS has developed so much that it is easy to contact through it. SNS is also available on a computer, but most would be familiar with using smartphones. Even though SNS is said to have developed, I think there are no more accessible means to contact than calling since most people bring their phones and can know them intuitively right away when they get a call.

Third, smartphones offer a variety of multimedia functions. You can listen to music, watch videos, and play games using your smartphone! Of course, you can use these functions with a game console, mp3, or computer, but few devices will be able to use all of these functions on one device. Also, when I play games, I often play in my free time, so I think I should be able to rest in the most comfortable position. And a smartphone is probably the device that best meets it.

In conclusion, I think most of the things mentioned above are about Convenience. The most significant advantage is that it is easy to carry around because it is a light and small device. It is no doubt that tools focused on this Convenience are the most necessary. And they are the things that have the most changed our lives and world.
