We mainly used feather pen as writing instruments in ancient medieval Europe. It was used as a pen using feathers of birds hollow inside the flagpole, such as geese and pheasant. However, after the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, many fountain pens were produced to fill ink pens and pens with ink.

The fountain pen was convenient at the time, but it did not write well on rough surfaces such as wood and leather, and the paper was often torn. Trying to solve this problem, British leather contractor John Lauer developed a new pen in 1888 that wraps steel beads with steel sockets. This pen can be said to be the beginning of the ballpoint pen, and the pen's development has made it possible to write on rough surfaces as well. It was not commercialized because of leakage of ink at the time of its first development and inconvenient to use.

The title of the perfect disposable product, which doesn't have to be ink-painted, filled with ink, or didn't have to leak ink, made the ballpoint pen an attractive item. The pencils were easily broken, and graphite was smeared on their hands, and they had to be cut with a knife every time the pencil lead was worn out. The pen had a problem with the record's speed because it was ink-painted every time it was written, and the ink had to be handled carefully. The ballpoint pen complements these shortcomings, and it is now taking the throne of writing instruments because of its low price and popularity.
