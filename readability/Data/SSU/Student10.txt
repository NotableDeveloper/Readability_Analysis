Wars have changed the world in many ways. Most people think that war brings a negative influence on humanity. However, the country that prepares war inputs everything of the country, workforce and manufacturing, production, and technology. Therefore, war has brought many technologies that people use in life.

First, wars had plenty of influence on the development of transportation. Before world war 1, the world record of airplanes was so low that can't be commercialized. But the four-year war has made it possible for planes to transport passengers.

Second, there was no war, but there was conspicuous development in space aviation technology during the cold war between America and the Soviet Union. They developed that technology to flaunt their technical skill. This made the people go out to the universe.

Finally, Computers were also developed by the war. During world war 2, there was a need to process a lot of data to effectively fight the war. Computers developed to speed up complex calculations, such as solving the enemy's code and calculating a ballistic trajectory.

In conclusion, war has caused pain to many people and left indelible scars, but it has dramatically impacted people. Therefore, wars are one of the essential things in the development of humanity.
