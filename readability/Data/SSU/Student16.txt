Countless things have affected the world to the point of change. One compelling invention that has transformed the world is a Bulb. Bulbs are a commercial version of fire for lighting that has had the most significant impact on humankind. As long as there is electricity, the bulb has better retention than fire, and the brightness is incomparable. Then from now on, there are many benefits thanks to the impact of the bulbs on the world.

First, Bulbs have allowed human beings to be active even in the evening without the sun. Before the bulb was invented, it had to rely on small lights, so only passive activities were possible. But after the invention of the bulb, people's lives have changed. Even on nights without the sun, they were able to live under bright light and became more active. It is no exaggeration to say that this has maximized the potential of the hours of human activity.

Second, Bulbs have helped people move underground. This benefit has had a lot of influence on the world. Human beings reached deep underground, enabling discoveries, collecting many resources, and securing more residences by moving buildings underground.

Third, Bulbs protected the safety of humans. Before the invention of the bulb, people depended on fire to live under less guaranteed security. However, after bulbs appeared globally, human lives could enjoy complete safety under bright light throughout the year. I think this played a part in the human race's rise to the pinnacle of the world.

In conclusion, bulbs have expanded the time and space of daily lives and helped them lead to bright safety. Therefore, bulbs had a lot of influence on the world.
