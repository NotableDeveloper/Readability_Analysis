Covid-19 has completely changed our lives. Some people even say that the pre-corona era is like a previous life. As the covid-19 cases continue to rise, schools, workplaces, religious communion, and public gathering spaces across the world remain closed. Nearly nine-in-ten U.S. adults say their life has changed at least a little due to covid-19 outbreaks, including 44% who say their life has changed in a significant way.

The most significant change that covid-19 brought to most of the people might be the income. The system created to prevent the spread of the epidemic was essential, but they caused enormous economic damage to those who were engaged in the profession and, in the worst case, lost their jobs. People had to find different jobs that were needed during covid-19.
The virus also affected students. Schools and universities were also unable to conduct regular classes, which also hindered the studentâ€™s learning. While there was no significant difference in cramming classes where students accepted and memorized information, classes where students participated, shared information, and learned from each other could not be operated normally.

The covid-19 affected various aspects of our daily lives on the surface; it also influenced our mental health. To avoid the spread of the virus, people made sure to keep a social distance from each other. As a result, people started to spend more time alone, which made people lonely and depressed.

The corona crisis has allowed us to experience a very different time; people started to feel grateful for the things they took for granted in the past. We can learn from the covid-19 pandemic about the importance of working together on problems.
