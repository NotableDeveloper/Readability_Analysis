What is one thing that has changed the world? 

Today, people usually use microwaves to warm up food. A microwave is a cooking tool that heats food using magnetron and electromagnetic waves. A microwave has become an essential kitchen appliance in a fast-paced modern society since it improves efficiency in cooking food.

When there was no microwave, people had to use a gas range to reheat chilled food. It took a long time to warm up chilled food using a gas range. Also, heating food in the summer would be hot and hard work because the heat of a gas range increased the kitchen's temperature. However, with the birth of a microwave, people have been able to reheat food in a short time and reheat it without turning up the temperature of a kitchen. So, a microwave has made heating food an easy task.

A microwave makes not only warming up food but also cooking food a simple task. For example, most ready meals have recipes using a microwave. Therefore, all people have to do is buy a ready meal at convenience stores or supermarkets and microwave it for a few minutes. Thanks to a microwave, people can shorten cooking time and have a quick and convenient meal when they don't have time.

In conclusion, a microwave with two advantages: saving time and uncomplicated cooking has become an indispensable home appliance and had a considerable impact on our diet. A microwave will continue to significantly influence people's lives in the future, as engineers will add various functions to a microwave, and ready meals that people make using a microwave will continue to develop.
