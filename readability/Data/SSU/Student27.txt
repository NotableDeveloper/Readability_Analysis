What is love?

From the past, all living things have been breeding and continuing their inheritance. Do they produce with anyone? Not really. We were able to continue our heritage because of love that made it possible to socialize with someone. Therefore, I think one thing that has changed and continued the world is love. Now let me tell you about how love has preserved living things and changed their world appropriately.

First, I think that maternal love for all living things has been a force to preserve them. Wild animals such as zebras and buffalo, as well as humans, can find their motherhood. I think protecting and raising babies at the expense of themselves is protecting and preserving them all.

Secondly, I think our sincere love for someone has changed our lives. There are people around us who are selfish and caring. But to our spouse or someone who is more deeply connected to us, or our neighbors, we sometimes express our sincere feelings. Living life can make us feel more harmonious by thinking and representing someone else, not just thinking about ourselves like this.

Finally, I think the love of the heart that likes someone is like  drugs. When you are in love, you are sweet and happy.  On the other hand,  if you have to be in trouble with love,  it may devaste the world. The more you do and the happier you are, but the more you feel, the more you feel, the more you feel, and the more you feel, the more difficult it is, I think, like drugs. But I don't think it's terrible to start love, and love is the contradiction between the front and the back.

In conclusion, in society, love is a universal power to humankind by man's intuitive feelings, enabling socializing with values other than personality. But my subject thinks that love comes from the fundamental mind of life and personal things. Therefore, I believe it is love that has changed and supported the world appropriately.
