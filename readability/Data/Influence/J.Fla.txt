I am absolutely thrilled to make an official announcement today about my original album! The very first song of my original album will be released on 6th September, with its music video. Understanding how long you have been waiting for this to happen, with your immense patience and knowing that you will soon be able to listen to my original song, makes me jump with joy. On that note, as I am flying out to the UK to shoot various music videos. Thank you again for being there for me and for being so patient. 'Grateful' doesn't even come close
