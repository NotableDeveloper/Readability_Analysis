WELL, I’LL LET MARCELO CHIME IN, BUT YEAH, WE’VE BEEN OBVIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THERE’S BEEN GYRATIONS AS TO YOU KNOW WHETHER IT COULD GET THROUGH FROM A PRICE OR GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT. NIY ONE THING THAT WAS NEVER CONFUSED, ESPECIALLY WITH MARCELO AND I, IS THAT THESE TWO COMPANIES MADE SENSE TOGETHER AND THE 5G ASPECTS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE COUNTRY AND CRITICAL FOR US WAS THE FLIPPING POINT AS TO THIS IS THE TIME AND IT MAKES GREAT SENSE.

ASK HIM WHO HIS PROVIDER IS BEFORE YOU TELL HIM ABOUT HIS BILL. HIS BILL IS GOING DOWN BECAUSE HE’S GOT THE DUMB AND DUMBER.
AT&T HAS SOLIDLY MOVED INTO THE DUMBER ROLE. SOLIDLY, ALL IN. I MEAN, THAT EGG THEY LAID THE OTHER DAY. COME ON. GO AHEAD, MARCELO?
I WON’T SAY 25% BUT I’LL SAY SERVICES ARE GONNA BE BROADENED AND PRICES ARE GONNA GO DOWN. SPEEDS ARE GONNA GO UP. THE 5G CAPABILITY IS GONNA BEYOND ANYTHING THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. JOBS ARE GONNA GO UP FROM DAY ONE. BOTH COMPANIES WILL HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAN THEY DID THE DAY THEY WERE SEPARATE. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, JIM, THE UNCARRIER, WHICH IS A FABRIC THAT SPRINT GAINED, AS WELL, IT’S THE COMPETITION OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS GOING TO SUPER CHARGE THAT. AND WHAT YOU’RE GET WITH THE NETWORK IS HIGHER SPEEDS, LOWER PRICES, AND I GOT NEWS FOR YOU: DUMB, DUMBER, WI-FI, AND SON OF WI-FI PIPE, YOU KNOW, OUR OTHER BIG COMPETITORS, THIS IS BAD NEWS FOR THEM. HERE IS SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU, JIM. WE’VE GOT TWO PIECES I THINK IS IMPORTANT. ONE IS TODAY WE WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT TO SHAREHOLDERS, BECAUSE THIS DEAL IS INCREDIBLE. OKAY. SO WHAT YOU GOT IS COMPANY AND WHEN IT COMES TOGETHER. PRO FORMA REVENUE THIS YEAR IS $75 BILLION. SERVICE REVENUE IS $55 TO $57 BILLION. $22 - $23 BILLION YEAR ONE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA. 40 TO 42% EBITDA MARGINS GROWING TO 55 TO 57. HOW ABOUT THIS, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE 2.9 TIMES NET DEBT LEVERAGE BUT IT WILL BE ABLE TO GO DOWN TWO TURNS BY THREE TO FOUR YEARS, AND THE REASON IS THE CASH FLOW IS GONNA GO FROM $1 TO $2 TO, IN 2022, IT’S GONNA BE $10 - $11 BILLION. IN 2025, THIS COMPANY IS GONNA GENERATE $16 - $18 BILLION DOLLARS OF FREE CASH FLOW. SYNERGIES, $43 BILLION. $6 BILLION RUN RATE. AND OF THAT, 93% ARE OPEX, 7% ARE CAP X. AND SO $26 BILLION ARE NETWORK SYNERGIES. SO THOSE ARE HARD SYNERGIES AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO THOSE.
DAVID, WE’VE BEEN WAITING TO DO THIS DEAL FOR SO LONG DO THE DEAL FOR SO LONG, AND THE DAY WE DO IT YOU GO TO OFF TO HOLLYWOOD WITH THE STARLETTES. I MEAN WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?
OKAY. AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, DAVID, THIS IS THE GAME THAT WE PUT OUR HELMETS ON TO PLAY TODAY. AFTER WE COME HERE, MEET WITH YOU GUYS, A COUPLE OF OTHER STOPS THAT ARE NOT AS RELEVANT AS CNBC AND ALL ROADS LEADS TO WASHINGTON. EVERYBODY’S GOT AN IDEA AS TO THE PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF THIS DEAL. HERE’S WHAT I SAY. I’LL START YOURS, FIRST. TAKE THAT COMPETITION AND SUPERCHARGE IT. YOU KNOW, PUT IT ON FASTER SPEEDS, BIGGER SCALE BRING LOWER PRICES, TAKE THAT – MY COMMITMENT, MARCELO’S COMMITMENT IS THAT IF YOU LIKE THE COMPETITION BEFORE, YOU’RE GONNA LOVE WHAT IS COMING WITH THIS ONE. SECONDLY, 5G IS COMING. AND BY THE WAY WITH THE HYPE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS HAD AROUND AT&T AND VERIZON’S MILLIMETER WAVE, WE ARE BEHIND. IT’S THE EARLY INNOVATION CYCLE OF 5G. WE ARE BEHIND CHINA. THIS IS NOT – THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN ALLOW. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST COMPANY, BECAUSE OF OUR AVAILABLE SPECTRUM, 600 MEGAHERTZ, 2.5 – TO BUILD THE NATIONWIDE BROAD COVERAGE 5G SERVICE. AND GUESS WHAT? CTIA SAYS THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN 5G CAN BRING 3 MILLION JOBS, 275 BILLION OF INVESTMENT, AND $500 BILLION OF ECONOMIC VALUE. BUT WE’RE BEHIND AND, BY THE WAY, WHAT WE ALSO HOPE TO DO IS GET DUMB AND DUMBER AND GET COMCAST AND OTHERS TO STEP UP THEIR INVESTMENT AND WE EXPECT THAT THEY’LL INVEST IN EXTRA $20 BILLION AND WE’RE GOING TO INVEST $40 BILLION IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS. THAT’S A STORY THAT WASHINGTON WANTS TO HEAR. IT’S NOT ABOUT FOUR TO THREE, IT’S ABOUT ZERO TO ONE. IT’S SUPERCHARGING THE UNCARRIER. IT’S ABOUT JOBS. THIS DEAL WILL GET APPROVED BECAUSE IT’S GREAT FOR THE UNITED STATES.
- HERE’S ANOTHER EYE OPENER. PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THIS DEAL BECAUSE TAX REFORM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE VALUE OF THIS DEAL. TAX REFORM HAS ALSO GIVEN US THE ENGINE THAT WE’RE GONNA BE ABLE TO USE WHILE WE’RE INVESTING TO HYPERCHARGE THIS. AND I WOULD SAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT AGENDAS IN WASHINGTON, LEADERSHIP WITH CHINA IS RISKING TAKING THE U.S. POSITION IN SUCH A CRITICAL AREA. I THINK WE’RE GOAL ALIGNED FROM A POLITICAL AGENDA.
BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR, DAVID. YOU ASKED BEFORE IF THERE WOULD EVER BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MARCELO AND I TO HAVE THANKSGIVING DINNER TOGETHER. AND THIS YEAR WE WILL. AND I WILL THROW POTATOES ON HIM AS I PROMISED. SO THAT’S –
MARCELO NEEDS TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT THE MOTHER OF ALL CUSTOMER LOADS IS SITTING IN VERIZON AND AT&T. 77% OF MY CUSTOMER ADS COME FROM THOSE, TOO. AND I THINK HE SHOULD FOCUS ON FIXING HIS COMPANY AND, YOU KNOW, JUST COPY, PASTE EVERYTHING I DO AND YOU’LL BE FINE.
I SAID IT TO HIM ON THE WAY IN. HEY LISTEN – WE HAVE HAD, AND WE WILL AS MARCELO SAID, A VERY COMPETITIVE SPIRIT. WE – IT’S JUST WHO WE ARE. OUR COMPANIES ARE THAT, HE AND I BOTH ARE THAT, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, WORST KEPT SECRET, UNFORTUNATELY, IS I LIKE THE GUY. WE – I ACTUALLY FOUND OUT, AS I SAID, IF I WAS TALL, YOUNG, HAD A BILLION DOLLARS, AND OWNED A FOOTBALL TEAM, WE’D ACTUALLY BE THE SAME PERSON. BUT OUTSIDE OF THOSE THINGS, YOU KNOW.
- SEVERAL THINGS, JIM. THE MAJORITY OF THE $40 BILLION WE’LL INVEST IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS IS TAKE 110,000 MACRO SITES IN THIS NETWORK, RIGHT SIZE THEM TO 85,000 WHILE INCREASING 10. HANG THE 2.5 NETWORK FROM A SPRINT ON OUR TOWERS AND OURS ON THEIRS AND HAVE AN INTEGRATED NETWORK. SO A LOT OF SPENDING. RURAL AMERICA JOBS. RURAL AMERICA STORES. U.S. CALL CENTERS EXPANSION TO CREATE THE CAPABILITY. SO THERE’S A FULL PLETHORA OF PLACES WHERE WE’RE GONNA SPEND THIS MONEY. AND SO I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IT’S GOING TO CAUSE THE REST OF THE PLAYERS TO SPEND MORE, TOO WHICH IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR AMERICA. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO TELLING THIS STORY EVERY MINUTE ALL DAY.
DAVID, YOU KNOW THIS IS  I’M SO HAPPY THAT YOU READ THE QUESTION THAT I E-MAILED YOU. I’M JUST KIDDING. LISTEN, HERE IS THE DEAL, YA READY? I’M ONLY GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE STATIOD. SO WHAT THEY’RE GOING IS THEY’RE BUILDING MILLIMETER WAVE. VERY HIGH BAND SPECTRUM IN SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS TO DO FIXED BROADBAND REPLACEMENT. OKAY, READY, GET YOUR PENCILS OUT. IF YOU USE MILLIMETER WAVE STRATEGY TO BUILD NATIONWIDE NETWORK, YOU NEED 1 SITE PER THOUSAND SQUARE YARDS WHICH MEAN YOU NEED 6 MILLION SITES AT 250,000 PER SITE, 1.5 TRILLION. AIN’T GOING TO HAPPEN. OKAY? THE ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE, THEY DON’T HAVE ACCESS SPECTRUM BECAUSE THEY’RE OUT, THEY WOULD NEED TO KICK THEIR CUSTOMERS OFF OF LTE, REFARM, AND GO TO 5G. IF IT WASN’T TV AND I WOULD SAY A WORD THEY ARE. AND THEY ARE EFFED. THEY’RE HOSED. THEY’VE GOT TO DO AN ABOVE FACE. THEY HAVE TO STOP LYING. THEY CAN’T DO SMALL MILLIMETER WAVE BROADBAND REPLACEMENT. AND THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO LEARN THAT IS WATCH SOMEBODY ELSE HELP THE UNITED STATES GAIN LEADERSHIP POSITION. AND THEN COME BACK AND IN AND SPEND THE MONEY THEY’RE WITHERING AWAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.
- OH YEAH, WELL, COME ON. HELP THOSE POOR PEOPLE. HELP THE MILITARY. HELP THE VETS. COME OVER TO T-MOBILE. LISTEN JIM, 26 MILLION OF THE 43 BILLION IS FROM NETWORK: SITE DECOMMISSIONING AND SITE AVOIDANCE, OK? THEN YOU’VE GOT 11 BILLION OF THAT, THAT IS SALES RATIONALIZATION, IT’S BACK OFFICE RATIONALIZATION. YOU’VE GOT 6 BILLION THAT IS I.T. AND SPENDING, ET CETERA. NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE NEW COMPANY IS GONNA BE CALLED T-MOBILE. BUT WHAT WE DIDN’T SAY YET, WE OWN THE BRANDS SPRINT, T-MOBILE, BOOST, METRO, VIRGIN. OKAY, WE HAVEN’T MADE DECISIONS YET. THAT’S AN AMAZING BRAND PORTFOLIO. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? WE HAVE 127 MILLION CUSTOMERS. 70 MILLION POSTPAID BRANDED CUSTOMERS AND 30 MILLION PREPAID. AND BY THE WAY, THAT’S 100 MILLION BRANDED CUSTOMERS. AT&T HAS 93 MILLION. WELCOME TO THE BACK OF THE BUS, AT&T. SO THERE’S A LOT TO DO AND AS YOU KNOW, ANY TIME YOU HAVE A JOB CREATION, SOME GO UP. SOME GO DOWN. THERE’S A RATIONALZATION. BUT THE NET IS AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITY.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I’M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT: 4G. LISTEN, JIM. IN 4G, WITH THE U.S. LEADERSHIP, THAT’S WHAT CREATED UBER. THAT’S WHAT CREATED SNAPCHAT, THAT’S WHAT CREATED AIRBNB. THAT’S WHAT ACCELERATED AMAZON AND FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE. SO WITH 5G INNOVATION, A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF ENTREPRENEURS ARE LOOKING AT WHAT TO DO WITH THE APPLICATIONS, WHERE TO PUT THAT NETWORK. THAT’S A BIG PIECE. OBVIOUSLY, FROM A TRADITIONAL TELECO STANDPOINT, THERE WILL BE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF EQUIPMENT. WE’RE RATIONALIZING THE ONES WE USE. BUT THE BIG WINNERS, THE BIG INNOVATION CYCLES ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CREATING 5G APPLICATIONS, IOT USES, SMART CITIES, SMART AGRICULTURE, THAT NEED THIS NETWORK ISN’T HERE YET. SO THAT’S A BIG ONE.
OKAY. JIM, HERE IS THE STORY. IN Q1 COMCAST ADDED MORE POSTPAID PHONE CUSTOMERS THAN AT&T AND VERIZON COMBINED. LAVS YEAR THEY ADDED MORE THAN AT&T AND VERIZON COMBINED. AND ANALYSTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT COMCAST AND CHARTER COULD ADD 5 MILLION CUSTOMERS IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AND THE NPV OF THE VALUE OF THEIR WIRELESS BUSINESS IS 20 BILLION, OK? WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE IT, AT&T IS THE LARGEST CABLE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES. RIGHT. SO THERE IS AN ADJACENT INDUSTRY GAME THAT’S GOING ON. IT’S NOT JUST WIRELESS. IT’S NOT JUST CABLE. WE WANT TO PLAY IN THOSE SPACES. AND, YES, COMCAST IT A VIABLE PLAYER IN THIS MARKET. AND THEY’RE RAMPING UP. CHARTER IS COMING IN. THEY’RE INVESTING TOGETHER.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS MAGENTA TEE SHIRT AND THESE SNEAKERS ARE GONNA BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY’RE GONNA BE IN THE DOJ, THE’RE GONNA BE IN THE FCC IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. I’M GONNA ANSWER EVERY SINGLE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE I HAVE THE RIGHT STORY ON OUR SIDE. WE’RE GOING TO DRIVE 5G THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS WE’RE GONNAL SAVE IT FROM BEHIND CHINA AND OTHERS THAT COULD BE A SECURITY THREAT. SUPER CHARGE THE UNCARRIER. BROADEN THE RURAL AMERICA OPPORTUNITIES, BROADBAND OPPORTUNITIES, LOWER PRICES WITHIN AND MORE JOBS. TALK ABOUT IT ANY WAY YOU WANT. SHAREHOLDERS ARE GONNA BRING HUGE VALUE. THIS DEAL WILL BE APPROVED. IT’S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. BUT I’M GONNA BE IN THERE ANY MY LANGUAGE AND MY CLOTHES TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
MY NAME IS JOHN. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMIT TO YOU, JIM, THAT THERE WILL BE MORE PEOPLE EMPLOYED FROM DAY ONE WITH BOTH COMPANIES COMBINED. PRICES FOR CONSUMERS WILL GO DOWN. PRICES FOR COMPETITIVE PEOPLE LIKE YOU WILL GO WAY DOWN. AND WE WILL INVEST $40 BILLION IN THE NEXT COMPANY IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND WE WILL DRIVE THE INNOVATION THAT COUNTRY NEEDS. AND DRIVE OTHERS TO MOVE FORWARD.
